# Spark-PrivacyPolicy
Privacy policy for the app "Spark" on google play.


We do not collect or use your data in any way outside of anonymous analytics provided to us by default from Google (e.g. crash reports, number of users who have downloaded the app). We currently use AdMob ads by google, and they will collect data about your advertisement viewing habits such as what you clicked on. However, we do not have any use for your data and have no plans to collect any ourselves, and certainly would never sell it to an outside party.
